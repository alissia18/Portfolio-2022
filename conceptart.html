                    This drawing was created in Clip Studio Paint. It is a design for a fantasy platformer game
                    that I was going to help develop, but the idea was scrapped due to time constraints. The game
                    had a heavy focus on atmosphere since each level was going to take place at a different time of day.
                    This was the setting for the first level of the game, in which the main character escapes an abandoned
                    astronomy observatory.
