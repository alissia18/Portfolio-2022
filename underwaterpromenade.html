                For this project, I followed the Blender 2.9 essentials course on LinkedIn Learning. First, I created the model for the fish; this was by far the most time-consuming part of the process. I spent days refining the sculpture and then painting it. Once this was done, I created the fishbowl, volcano, and rocks. After that was done, it was time to texture the pieces. Finally, I moved onto animating the elements. The fish animation was relatively easy; although I ran into some technical problems at first, I managed to get it to run smoothly. I also added some bubble animations, and a fire simulator for the volcano. 
                <br><br>The intention of this project was to familiarize myself with Blender and 3D animation concepts while creating an immersive, smooth yet simple animation. I focused on experimenting with a variety of textures to see how each one would behave. This project may not be interactive, but now that I have completed it, I believe I am more prepared to tackle interactive projects in the future. I would love to make my own 3D open-world game someday; these games allow for vivid, immersive storytelling.
